Odessa is a board that have a Zeus [[http://www.grodansparadis.com/wiki/doku.php?id=zeus_expansion_interface|expansion interface]]. and normally is the base for some of our other products and then also have an expansion board permanently mounted for some particular use. However as the module also can be useful as a starting point for custom projects as well we also sell it as a product of its own. All you need to do is to add your custom expansion card to the module and write the code to interface it.

The module comes with a GUID and programmed with a bootloader and VSCP module functionality that out of the box (as a sample) just work as a digital output module but which easily can be extended to set up with your own functionality.

The module have a [[http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=PIC18F26K80|PIC18F26K80]] installed which have 64 Kbytes of Flash, 1Kbytes of EEPROM and 3,648 bytes of ram. 

The standard version of this module is a 3.3V version but a special version is also available which is 5V based.
